Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session

Course Description
------------------

This course investigates current legal, scientific, and policy issues surrounding the issues important to the working environment. These include the regulation of toxic substances and processes that affect the health and safety of workers, the economics of health and safety, labor and anti-discrimination law, worker right-to-know, and workers' compensation.

Class Format
------------

You should read the materials for each topic before class. We encourage discussion initiated by the class, will ask questions of you, and will grade you—in part—on your preparation and participation.

Requirements
------------

In addition to class preparation, there will be a relatively short (around 5 pages) writing assignment, a midterm, and a (non-cumulative) second exam. (**Note**: The writing assignment will not be a "paper" in the traditional sense of the term. Everyone will be asked to respond to the same question.)

Grading will be approximately as follows:
